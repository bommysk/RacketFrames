# RacketFrames

This is RacketFrames. DataFrames from the popular Pandas library implemented in Racket.

## Getting Started

In this day and age procedural and functional programmers alike are working with large amounts of data. Many analytical libraries have been developed for many domains. Python/pandas, R or even the command prompt can be used to accomplish theses taks, but this option is especially good if you are 1) using Racket already 2) may need to integrate your solution with other Racket applications in the future or 3) just plain love functional programming.

You can answer this question and many others with RacketFrames.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
